## Welcome to My journey to full stack developer 

```
what is full stack ?
In the world of software programming, it helps to have someone on the team who is something of a jack of all trades.

A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client facing and server side software.
Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, 
from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well.

The modern full stack developer is an experienced generalist who can build a minimal viable product
— i.e., an application with enough functionality to please early customers and spark feedback for continued development 
— on their own.
